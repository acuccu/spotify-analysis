# spotify-analysis (temporary project man)

## Background

Spotify's API offers developerers offers an incredibly interesting amount of data to be analyzed and displayed.
Alongside the usual historical metada, developers have access to mood analysis (anceability, valence, energy, tempo),
properties (loudness, speechiness, instrumentalness), context (liveness or acousticness), and 
segments (tatums, bars, beats, pitches). This prohject will analyze, compile and display this data, giving the user the ability
to find tracks and artists with similar moods and properties by using the Echo Nest Api (a spotify partner). 

## Functionality & MVP 

* Search for artists, albums, and tracks.
* Display information regarding mood, properties, and context. 
* Suggest tracks with similar properties. 
Bonus: 
* Map displaying mood, properties, and context of top tracks by location. 

## Wireframe & File Structure

The app will consist of a single screen with a search bar, a radial display for data visualization, and 
nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn. The app will in addition display historical information for the track, or biographical 
information for artists along genre tags and album art. 

File Structure will be updated further in the project.
