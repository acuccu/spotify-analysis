# Spotify Track Analysis

## Background

Spotify Track Analysis is a data visualization tool. Combining the powers of the Spotify API and the D3 JavaScript library, this instrument can display information about your favorite songs. Hosted by a server created using Express.js, this web app is authenticated through OAuth - you'll never have to use any credentials to access this tool.

## Functionality

* Search for artists, albums, and tracks.
* Display information regarding mood, properties, and context. 


## Visualized Values

* Danceability - Wether the track has a beat or not
* Tempo - Measured in beats per minute (BPM)
* Valence - The mood of the track
* Key - The pitch of the track
* Energy - Is the track fast-moving and chaotic, or slow and tame?

## How to Search

At the moment, the search function uses a song's name and returns the first result. In future developments, users will be able to refine searches by artist
